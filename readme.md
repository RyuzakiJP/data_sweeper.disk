  [PROGRAM START]
  
  This Disk is meant to be given to my old friend in the events of my passing/dissapearance no one else should get access to this Disk.
  I entrust you this. If you're booting that disk out of curiosity, leave it alone. Else, boot it with the correct passsword as a parameter.
  
  [PROGRAM END]

  root@J > run data_sweeper.disk *************
  
  Started program on /dev/floppyDisk01...
  
  [PROGRAM START]
  
  Hello.
  
  ...
  
  If you're booting this, then something probably happened.
  
  In case you forgot what this was: If you run this Floppy anywhere, it will COMPLETELY WIPED OUT ANYTHING CONNECTED TO IT.
  Including your Cortex. Simple as that, scary as that. Impossible to recover, everything is wiped out forever.
  
  This. This was the last project on my awful life. I've seen, heard, imagined and felt a lot of things. Things i just want to forget.
  Wiping the Cortex is dangerous stuff and nobody has done it before as far as i'm aware, but i'm willing to risk it all.
  
  In case this EVER ends up working, all my data will be wiped from the Metaverse and from my Cortex. IN THEORY that means that the Cortex will
  force-enter Panic Recovery Mode. That way i'll be able to start anew, Factory-New Cortex, brand new Metaverse Profile, brand new life.
  The past will be in the past, You'll wont even remember it! Just move out and that is. That is, if the Cortex has a Recovery Partition...
  
  What if it does not? Well... that means my Cortex is fried. I'll die a painful death as all my brain data is corrupted bit by bit by the program.
  
  In case you are who i think this is, you know the implications of this. I'm sorry. If you ever hear from me again, i hope its not on the news.
  
  I've encrypted the Source Code so nobody is ever able to modify it, but the Disk is operational. The Disk is in your hands now. Use it however you want it to.
